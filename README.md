# FlowMatch Euler Discrete Scheduler for ComfyUI

9 steps, big res, zero noise.

**FlowMatchEulerDiscrete** seems not exposed in ComfyUI, but it is what the official Z-Image demo in diffusers use.

So:

- I am exposing it in the scheduler section for you to use within KSampler.
- On top I provide a node, experimental, to configure the scheduler for use with CustomSampler and play with.

In short...if you want **sharper and noise free images**, use this!

## Installation

- use comfy ui manager (search erosDiffusion or ComfyUI-EulerFlowMatchingDiscreteScheduler)

or

- `git clone https://github.com/erosDiffusion/ComfyUI-EulerDiscreteScheduler.git` in your custom nodes folder.

Example output (more below)

## What you get

- one new scheduler **FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler** registered in the KSampler
- a custom node that exposes all parameters of the FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler which Outputs **SIGMAS** for use with **SamplerCustom** node.

## Usage

- **Simple**: select the FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler in the default workflow from ComfyUI and run.
- **Advanced/experimental**:
  1. Add **FlowMatch Euler Discrete Scheduler (Custom)** node to your workflow
  2. Connect its SIGMAS output to **SamplerCustom** node's sigmas input
  3. Adjust parameters to control the sampling behavior, you have ALL the parameters to play with.

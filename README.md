# FlowMatch Euler Discrete Scheduler for ComfyUI

**FlowMatchEulerDiscrete** seems not exposed in comfy, but it is what the official demo in diffusers use.
So I am exposing it in the scheduler section and provide a node, experimental, to configure the scheduler for use with CustomSampler
So...if you want **sharper and more noise free images**, you can experiment with this.

## Installation
this is an alpha stage node, so not esposed yet in manager. to install
open a terminal command in your custom nodes then, you do have git installed I assume, then...:

```git clone https://github.com/erosDiffusion/ComfyUI-EulerDiscreteScheduler.git```

Custom node that exposes all parameters of the FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler. Outputs SIGMAS for use with **SamplerCustom** node.

![highlight](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/249cd15d-f373-46c7-bacb-13a4b5421ba3)

## Usage

1. Add **FlowMatch Euler Discrete Scheduler (Custom)** node to your workflow
2. Connect its SIGMAS output to **SamplerCustom** node's sigmas input
3. Adjust parameters to control the sampling behavior

## Example Workflow

```
Model -> SamplerCustom
         ^ 
         |
         FlowMatch Euler Scheduler (steps=30, use_karras_sigmas=True)
```
